# D2SC
D2SC is an R package to calculate the Distance to the Second Class proposed by Mitchell et al. 2008. The Distance to the Second Class can be used as indicator of classification confidence in Land Use / Land Cover classification problems. The D2SC package makes it easy to calculate the distance between two classes from `raster` objects.
