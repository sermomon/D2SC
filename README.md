# D2SC
D2SC is a light R package to calculate the Distance to the Second Class proposed by [Mitchell et al. 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2007.12.006). The Distance to the Second Class can be used as indicator of classification confidence in Land Use / Land Cover classification problems. The D2SC package makes it easy to calculate the distance between two classes from `raster` objects (RasterStack or RasterBrick) which contain the probability of belonging to each class.
